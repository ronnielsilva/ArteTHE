Simple jQuery Carousel Slider - Demo Files
==========================================

These are the demo files for the tutorial at: http://paulmason.name/item/simple-jquery-carousel-slider-tutorial

This is a simple jQuery carousel slider that I use quite often in my projects, it's the most basic version and a great starting point if you want to learn how to use animation with jQuery.

With this slider you'll be able to easily change the dimensions, animation times, and choose custom classes/id's for the container and slides (handy for applying to existing html).
